# Lab 2: B+ Tree Index

## 1. Overview

The goal of this lab is to implement a complete **B+ Tree Index** for the OneBase database. The B+ Tree is the most widely used index structure in relational databases -- it supports efficient point queries and range queries, with O(log n) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion.

You will implement the following four components:

1. **Internal Page** (`src/storage/page/b_plus_tree_internal_page.cpp`) -- B+ Tree internal node page
2. **Leaf Page** (`src/storage/page/b_plus_tree_leaf_page.cpp`) -- B+ Tree leaf node page
3. **B+ Tree** (`src/storage/index/b_plus_tree.cpp`) -- Core B+ Tree operations (search, insert, delete)
4. **B+ Tree Iterator** (`src/storage/index/b_plus_tree_iterator.cpp`) -- Sequential traversal of leaf nodes

## 2. Background

### 2.1 B+ Tree Structure

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │  Internal   │
                    │  [_, 5, 10] │        key[0] is invalid
                    │ p0  p1  p2  │        value[i] is child page_id
                    └──┬────┬────┬┘
                       │    │    │
           ┌───────────┘    │    └───────────┐
           ▼                ▼                ▼
    ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐
    │   Leaf       │ │   Leaf       │ │   Leaf       │
    │ [1,2,3,4]   │→│ [5,6,7,8,9] │→│ [10,11,12]  │
    │  v v v v     │ │  v v v v v  │ │  v  v  v    │
    └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘
         next_page_id →    next_page_id →    INVALID
```

**Key Properties:**
- All data is stored in leaf nodes
- Internal nodes only store routing keys + child pointers
- Leaf nodes are linked via `next_page_id_` forming a singly linked list
- The `array_[0].first` (first key) of an internal node is invalid; only `array_[0].second` (pointer) is valid

### 2.2 Page Layout

Each B+ Tree node is stored in a database page. The memory layout of a page is as follows:

```
┌─────────────────── Page (4096 bytes) ────────────────────┐
│                                                          │
│  BPlusTreePage header:                                   │
│    page_type_     (IndexPageType: LEAF or INTERNAL)      │
│    size_          (current number of key-value pairs)     │
│    max_size_      (maximum capacity)                      │
│    parent_page_id_ (parent node page_id)                  │
│                                                          │
│  [Leaf only] next_page_id_  (next leaf node)              │
│                                                          │
│  array_[0]:  { key_0, value_0 }                          │
│  array_[1]:  { key_1, value_1 }                          │
│  ...                                                     │
│  array_[n-1]: { key_{n-1}, value_{n-1} }                 │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Important Details:**
- `array_[0]` uses the C flexible array member trick (declared as `std::pair<KeyType, ValueType> array_[0]`)
- The actual usable array size is determined by `max_size_`, using `reinterpret_cast` to treat the Page's `data_` region as the node
- For internal nodes: `ValueType` = `page_id_t` (child page ID)
- For leaf nodes: `ValueType` = `RID` (record identifier)

### 2.3 Split and Merge

**Split:** Triggered when `size > max_size` after insertion into a node

```
Before split (leaf, max_size=4):
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]     <- size=5 > max_size=4, split required

After split:
  Original node: [1, 2]       <- keep the first half
  New node:      [3, 4, 5]    <- second half moves to new node
  Push up: key=3 to parent node
```

**Merge:** Triggered when `size < min_size` after deletion from a node
- `min_size` = `max_size / 2` (leaf nodes) or `(max_size + 1) / 2` (internal nodes)
- First attempt to **Redistribute** from a sibling node
- If the sibling is also not rich enough, **Merge** the two nodes

### 2.4 KeyComparator

The B+ Tree is a template class `BPlusTree<KeyType, ValueType, KeyComparator>`. The default instantiation in this project is:
- `KeyType` = `int`
- `ValueType` = `RID`
- `KeyComparator` = `std::less<int>`

`comparator(a, b)` returns `true` meaning `a < b`.

> **Note:** The current iterator design does not include a `BufferPoolManager*` member, which means the iterator cannot fetch pages through BPM. If you need to traverse across leaf nodes, you will need to modify the iterator header file to add the necessary member variables.

## 4. Implementation Guide

### 4.1 Internal Page

**`Init(max_size)`:**
```
SetPageType(IndexPageType::INTERNAL_PAGE);
SetSize(0);
SetMaxSize(max_size);
SetParentPageId(INVALID_PAGE_ID);
```

**`Lookup(key, comparator)`:**

Find which child node the key should be routed to in an internal node.

Array layout: `[_, k1, k2, k3, ...]`, corresponding values `[p0, p1, p2, p3, ...]`
- If `key < k1`, go to p0
- If `k1 <= key < k2`, go to p1
- And so on

```
result = array_[0].second   // default to the first child
for i = 1 to size-1:
    if comparator(key, array_[i].first):   // key < array_[i].key
        break
    result = array_[i].second
return result
```

**`InsertNodeAfter(old_value, key, new_value)`:**
1. Find the index `idx` of `old_value`
2. Shift elements in `[idx+1, size)` one position to the right
3. Place `{key, new_value}` at position `idx+1`
4. `IncreaseSize(1)`

**`MoveHalfTo(recipient, middle_key)`:**
```
split_idx = size / 2   // for internal nodes
Copy array_[split_idx+1 .. size-1] to recipient
Set the first key of recipient to middle_key (the original array_[split_idx].key is pushed up to the parent)
Adjust size
```

### 4.2 Leaf Page

**`KeyIndex(key, comparator)`:**

Find the first position >= key (sorted insertion point). You can use linear scan or binary search:

```
for i = 0 to size-1:
    if !comparator(array_[i].first, key):  // array_[i].key >= key
        return i
return size
```

**`Insert(key, value, comparator)`:**
1. Call `KeyIndex(key)` to find the insertion position `idx`
2. If `idx < size && array_[idx].key == key`, return current size (duplicate key, do not insert)
3. Shift elements in `[idx, size)` one position to the right
4. Place `{key, value}` at position `idx`
5. `IncreaseSize(1)`

**`MoveHalfTo(recipient)`:**
```
split_idx = size / 2
Copy array_[split_idx .. size-1] to recipient's array_[0..]
Set recipient's next_page_id_ = this node's original next_page_id_
Set this node's next_page_id_ to recipient's page_id
Adjust size for both nodes
```

### 4.3 B+ Tree Core Operations

**`GetValue(key, result)`:**
1. If the tree is empty, return false
2. Starting from the root node, use `Lookup()` to traverse downward until reaching a leaf node
3. Call `Lookup(key, &value)` on the leaf node
4. If found, add the value to the result vector and return true

**Note:** Each time you access a page, you need to obtain it via `bpm_->FetchPage(page_id)` and release it with `bpm_->UnpinPage(page_id, false)` after use.

**`Insert(key, value)`:**

This is the most complex method. The core flow:

```
1. If the tree is empty:
   a. Create a new leaf page as the root
   b. Insert the key-value
   c. Return true

2. Find the leaf node (traverse downward from root)

3. Insert the key-value into the leaf node
   - If it is a duplicate key, return false

4. If the leaf node overflows (size > max_size):
   a. Create a new leaf node
   b. Call MoveHalfTo to split
   c. Push the first key of the new leaf node up to the parent
   d. InsertIntoParent(old_leaf, key, new_leaf)

5. InsertIntoParent handles recursively:
   a. If the old node is the root, create a new root
   b. Call InsertNodeAfter on the parent node
   c. If the parent also overflows, continue splitting the parent (recursion)
```

**`Remove(key)`:**

```
1. Find the leaf node containing the key
2. Remove the key from the leaf
3. If the leaf size < min_size, adjustment is needed:
   a. Try to Redistribute from the left or right sibling
   b. If the sibling is not rich enough, Merge with the sibling
   c. Merge may cause the parent node to also need adjustment (recurse upward)
4. Special case: if the root node has only one child left, replace the root with the child
```

### 4.4 B+ Tree Iterator

The iterator needs to be able to traverse all leaf nodes. Basic design:

```
Member variables:
  page_id_   page_id of the current leaf node
  index_     current index in the leaf node's array_

operator++():
  index_++
  if index_ >= current leaf node's size:
    page_id_ = current leaf node's next_page_id_
    index_ = 0

IsEnd():
  return page_id_ == INVALID_PAGE_ID
```

> **Design Limitation:** The current iterator header file lacks a `BufferPoolManager*` pointer, so `operator*()` and `operator++()` cannot directly fetch page data through BPM. You need to add a `BufferPoolManager *bpm_` member to the header file to solve this problem, or consider caching the necessary data within the iterator.

## 5. Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the project
cd build && cmake --build . -j$(nproc)

# Run Lab 2 related tests
ctest --test-dir build -R b_plus_tree_internal_page_test --output-on-failure
ctest --test-dir build -R b_plus_tree_leaf_page_test --output-on-failure
ctest --test-dir build -R b_plus_tree_test --output-on-failure
ctest --test-dir build -R b_plus_tree_iterator_test --output-on-failure

# Run all tests
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

### Debugging Tips

- Use print statements to output the tree structure: traverse each level and print keys and sizes
- Test simple sequential insertions first, then out-of-order/random insertions
- Implement `GetValue` + `Insert` (without split) first to verify basic functionality
- Then add split logic
- Finally implement deletion (the most complex part)

## 6. Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting to UnpinPage**: After every `FetchPage` or `NewPage`, the page must be unpinned with `UnpinPage` when done. Missing this will cause buffer pool overflow
2. **Internal node key[0] is invalid**: The `array_[0].first` of an internal node does not store a valid key; only `array_[0].second` (child page pointer) is valid. Key traversal starts from index=1
3. **Forgetting to update parent pointers after split**: The children of newly created nodes have not had their `parent_page_id_` updated
4. **Leaf node linked list maintenance**: When splitting a leaf node, the new node's `next_page_id_` should point to the original node's old `next_page_id_`, and the original node's `next_page_id_` should be updated to the new node's page_id
5. **Choosing the key to push up during split**:
   - Leaf split: push up the first key of the new node (the key is still retained in the leaf)
   - Internal split: push up the middle key (the key is removed from the internal node)
6. **Merge direction**: When merging, make sure to update the parent node's key and child pointers, as well as the `parent_page_id_` of the merged node's children
7. **Root node special handling**: Deletion may cause the root node to have only one child remaining; in this case, the child should be promoted to become the new root
8. **Difference between max_size and min_size**: During insertion, check `size > max_size` (insert first, then check); during deletion, check `size < min_size`
